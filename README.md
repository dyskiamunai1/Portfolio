# 👨‍💻 Ahmed's Tech Portfolio

Welcome to my personal coding portfolio. I'm currently on a focused path to become a skilled software engineer in Python, AWS, AI, and Cybersecurity. This repo tracks my learning journey and showcases hands-on projects I’m building along the way.

## 🛠️ Current Focus Areas

| Area            | What I'm Building / Learning                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Python          | Scripts, automation tools, Flask apps                 |
| AWS             | Cloud deployment, S3/EC2/Lambda basics                |
| Cybersecurity   | CEH prep, log analysis, security automation           |
| AI/ML           | Basic models (spam filter, sentiment analysis)        |
| Satellite Tech  | Exploring AI-powered Earth observation (future)       |

## 📁 Project List (In Progress)

- **Log Monitor** – Python script to scan `.log` files (Coming Soon)
- **Flask App** – Web app using Flask (`flask_app/app.py`) ✅ Live
- **Spam Classifier** – ML model to detect spam emails (Coming Soon)

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Computer Science major with a background in CCNA, CEH, and Python. I learn through slow, deep repetition and build with purpose.
